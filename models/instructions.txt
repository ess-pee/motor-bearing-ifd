Authors Note: I am only human after all, and thus I am lazy. 

The decoded labels do not actually have the beautiful names you see in the JSON encodings. 
When you train the models on the data the class names come out ugly.
So I hard coded the beautiful mappins. Below are the mappings of all the encodings.

CWRU Dataset encoding mappings:
    ["B", "IR", "N", "OR"] = ["Ball Fault", "Inner Race Fault", "Healthy", "Outer Race Fault"]

MAFAULDA Dataset encoding mappings:
    ["ball", "cage", "normal", "outer"] = ["Ball Fault", "Cage Fault", "Healthy", "Outer Race Fault"]

Triaxial Dataset encoding mappings:
    ["Healthy", "Inner", "Outer"] = ["Healthy", "Inner Race Fault", "Outer Race Fault"]

Indeed in retrospect I could have made these mappings in the preprocessing file, but I'm tired boss. 
Although I doubt anyone will do this, but feel free to implement a mapping system.
